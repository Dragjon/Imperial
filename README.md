## Overview
Imperious was created out of boredom. After trying to improve my other engine Polonium for a while now and hitting a dead end, I decided to revisit python to hopefully learn some new tricks about engine dev that I can implement easily. Imperious won't be the best engine, but it certainly won't be the worse - I think.
